Kassandra allows designing of anomaly detection policies. Prerequisites Prepare environment Install Python 3 and pip apt install -y python3 pip3 virtualenv Installation 1. Download the source from here . 2. Create virtualenv virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv source venv/bin/activate 3. Install requirements Run install.bat Getting started To start running Kassandra 0.1 run the following on the root folder of the project. python kassandra.py This will run an example by default. Try on my own Needed files To test Kassandra with you own files you should change here the path to those files. You will need: 1. Train file. Log file with a huge number (40000 is OK) of HTTP requests of a server. 2. Test file. Log file with some HTTP requests for testing. Designing of anomaly detection policies You can also customize the anomaly values obtained by editing config.yml * Danger values are reserved to change the weigh for each characteristc * Extended Isolation Forests are reserved for adjust the Machine Learning model to the training data Running tests To run any test run the following command, being \"test_file\" any of the files present on the root folder like \"tst_level_*.py\". python filename Each test file can be edited to run a different set of HTTP requests, modify the corresponding file name according to: * Level 1 tests in here * Level 2 tests in here Run Dockerfile 1. Build docker image build -t kassandra . 2. Run docker run -p kassandra License Distributed under the Apache 2.0 License. See LICENSE for more information.
